# simple todo app
 Here is the technical task for this web app:

Necessary:

- write the code yourself, and not copy from stackoverflow;
- use React;
- use components as functions, not as classes;
- use hooks;
- use github for "layout".

Desirable:
- use dayjs to work with dates;
- use firebase.google.com as Back-end;
- use firebase.google.com or now.sh as hosting the client part;
- use less if you need to write styles;
- try not to use any libraries other than those necessary for communicating with the Back-end.

It is not required to make a super-beautiful UI and functions not described in the task.

❔ -> I could have used less for styling. But, at first, I planned not to write much styling so went for css then when I realized I need LESS | SCSS, It wass too late, I had a lot of code that I didn't want to rewrite.<br><br>

This project was amazing for me to do. I loved the process.
