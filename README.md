❌ didn't use less, read ❔ part for more.

❔ -> I could have used less for styling. But, at first, I planned not to write much styling so went for css then when I realized I need LESS | SCSS, It wass too late, I had a lot of code that I didn't want to rewrite.

This project was amazing for me to do. I loved the process.
